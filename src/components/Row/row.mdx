# Row Component Documentation

## Overview

The `Row` component is a layout component used to create a row-based container for aligning and spacing children elements. It provides flexibility in controlling the gap between items, vertical alignment, and horizontal alignment using Tailwind CSS utility classes.

## Basic Example

```tsx
import Row from './Row';

function App() {
  return (
    <Row gap="medium" alignItems="center" justifyContent="between">
      <div>Item 1</div>
      <div>Item 2</div>
      <div>Item 3</div>
    </Row>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the Row component arranges three items in a row, with medium spacing between them, vertically aligned in the center, and the items spaced between horizontally.

## Row Properties

The Row component accepts the following props:

- **children** (`ReactNode`): The content to be placed inside the row (required).
- **gap** (`'none' | 'small' | 'medium' | 'large'`): Specifies the gap between the items in the row. Default is 'medium'.
- **alignItems** (`'start' | 'center' | 'end'`): Controls the vertical alignment of items within the row. Default is 'start'.
- **justifyContent** (`'start' | 'center' | 'end' | 'between' | 'around'`): Specifies how the items are distributed horizontally within the row. Default is 'start'.

## Example with Different Gap and Alignment

```tsx
import Row from './Row';

function App() {
  return (
    <Row gap="large" alignItems="end" justifyContent="around">
      <div>Item 1</div>
      <div>Item 2</div>
      <div>Item 3</div>
    </Row>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the Row component arranges the items with large gaps between them, aligned at the bottom vertically, and distributed evenly around the row horizontally.

## Customization

The Row component can be customized in the following ways:

- **gap**: Control the spacing between child elements with values 'none', 'small', 'medium', or 'large'. The default is 'medium'.
- **alignItems**: Adjust the vertical alignment of the children with values 'start', 'center', or 'end'. The default is 'start'.
- **justifyContent**: Manage the horizontal alignment of the children with options like 'start', 'center', 'end', 'between', or 'around'. The default is 'start'.

## Notes

- The Row component uses Tailwind CSS classes to handle the layout styles, ensuring responsiveness and flexibility.
- The default gap is 'medium', which provides a reasonable space between items.
- The alignItems and justifyContent properties provide simple control over vertical and horizontal alignment.
