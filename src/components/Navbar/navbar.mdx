# Navbar Component Documentation  

## Overview  

The `Navbar` component is used to create a navigation bar with a logo and a set of links. It is responsive, displaying the links horizontally on larger screens and as a toggleable dropdown on smaller screens. This component supports custom logos and optional text descriptions.  

## Basic Example  

```tsx  
import Navbar from './Navbar';  

function App() {  
  const links = [  
    { name: 'Home', href: '/' },  
    { name: 'About', href: '/about' },  
    { name: 'Contact', href: '/contact' },  
  ];  

  return (  
    <div>  
      <Navbar links={links} logoSrc="/logo.png" />  
    </div>  
  );  
}  

export default App;  
```  

This example demonstrates the basic usage of the Navbar component with a logo and links.  

## Navbar Properties  

The Navbar component accepts the following props:  

- `links` (`{ name: string; href: string }[]`): An array of objects representing the links in the navbar (required).  
- `logoSrc` (string): The source URL for the logo image (required).  
- `altText` (string): Optional text to describe the logo for accessibility. Defaults to 'Logo'.  
- `className` (string): Custom class names to apply additional styling to the entire navbar.  

## Example with Custom Logo and Links  

```tsx  
import Navbar from './Navbar';  

function App() {  
  const links = [  
    { name: 'Home', href: '/' },  
    { name: 'Services', href: '/services' },  
    { name: 'Contact', href: '/contact' },  
  ];  

  return (  
    <div>  
      <Navbar  
        links={links}  
        logoSrc="/custom-logo.png"  
        altText="Custom Logo"  
        className="bg-gray-900"  
      />  
    </div>  
  );  
}  

export default App;  
```  

In this example, a custom logo and links are passed as props, and an additional background color is added to the navbar using the className prop.  

## Responsive Design  

The Navbar component is fully responsive. On larger screens (medium and above), the links are displayed in a horizontal row. On smaller screens, a hamburger menu is displayed, and the links can be toggled open or closed.  

### Mobile View  

On smaller screens, the links are hidden by default. When the menu button is clicked, the links appear in a vertical list:  

```tsx  
<button onClick={() => setIsOpen(!isOpen)} className="text-white">  
  {isOpen ? 'Close' : 'Menu'}  
</button>  
```  

The `isOpen` state controls whether the mobile menu is shown or hidden.  

## Customization  

The Navbar component can be customized in the following ways:  

- `links`: An array of objects representing the navigation links. Each object must contain a name (link text) and a href (link URL).  
- `logoSrc`: The source URL for the logo image.  
- `altText`: A description of the logo for accessibility purposes. Defaults to 'Logo'.  
- `className`: Use this to apply additional styles or override default styles with Tailwind classes.  

## Notes  

- The navbar is designed to be fully responsive, with a mobile-friendly dropdown for smaller screens.  
- The `className` prop allows you to customize the appearance of the navbar, such as background color, padding, and spacing.  
- The `isOpen` state is used to control the visibility of the dropdown menu on mobile screens. This state is toggled when the menu button is clicked.
