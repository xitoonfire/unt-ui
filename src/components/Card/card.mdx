# Card Component Documentation

## Overview

The `Card` component is a flexible and customizable card used to display content such as images, titles, descriptions, and action buttons. It provides a simple way to present content in a visually appealing layout. The component is built with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Basic Example

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Card from "./Card";

function App() {
  const handleButtonClick = () => {
    alert("Button clicked!");
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <Card
        title="Card Title"
        imageUrl="https://via.placeholder.com/150"
        content="This is a description of the card's content."
        buttonText="Learn More"
        onButtonClick={handleButtonClick}
      />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Card Properties

The Card component accepts the following props:

- `title`: A string representing the card's title (e.g., "Card Title").
- `imageUrl`: A string representing the URL of the image to be displayed in the card.
- `content`: A string representing the main content or description of the card.
- `buttonText`: A string for the text to be displayed on the action button.
- `onButtonClick`: A function that will be called when the action button is clicked.

```tsx
<Card
  title="Card Title"
  imageUrl="https://via.placeholder.com/150"
  content="This is a description of the card."
  buttonText="Click Me"
  onButtonClick={() => console.log("Button clicked!")}
/>
```

## Button Functionality

The card includes an action button that can trigger a custom action when clicked. The `onButtonClick` prop accepts a function that will be executed when the button is clicked.

```tsx
<Card
  title="Card with Button"
  imageUrl="https://via.placeholder.com/150"
  content="This card has a button that performs an action."
  buttonText="Click Me"
  onButtonClick={() => alert("Button clicked!")}
/>
```
